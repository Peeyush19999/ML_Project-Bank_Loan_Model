# ML_Project-Bank_Loan_Model


# Objective:
The classification goal is to predict the likelihood of a liability customer buying personal
loans.

# Steps and tasks:
1. Import the datasets and libraries, check datatype, statistical summary, shape, null
values etc
2. Check if you need to clean the data for any of the variables
3. EDA: Study the data distribution in each attribute and target variable, share your
findings.
● Number of unique in each column?
● Number of people with zero mortgage?
● Number of people with zero credit card spending per month?
● Value counts of all categorical columns.
● Univariate and Bivariate analysis
4. Apply necessary transformations for the feature variables
5. Normalise your data and split the data into training and test set in the ratio of 70:30
respectively
6. Use the Logistic Regression model to predict the likelihood of a customer buying
personal loans.
7. Print all the metrics related for evaluating the model performance
8. Build various other classification algorithms and compare their performance
9. Give a business understanding of your model
